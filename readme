# Online Receipt Management System

## Overview

The **Online Receipt Management System** is a web-based application designed to automate the creation, management, and delivery of receipts for business transactions. It streamlines the process of recording customer purchases, calculating totals and discounts, and storing transaction records in a database. The system also allows users to view receipt details and send receipts via email to customers.

## Features

- **Receipt Creation**: The system allows users to create detailed receipts for customers, including customer information, product details, quantities, prices, discounts, and the total amount.
- **Add Multiple Products**: Users can dynamically add multiple products to the receipt form, with automatic calculation of subtotals and discounts.
- **Invoice Storage**: Receipt and product information is securely stored in a database (MySQL) with unique receipt IDs for each transaction.
- **Receipt View**: View individual receipt details, including customer data, product breakdown, and transaction total.
- **Send Receipts via Email**: Send the receipt directly to customers via email.
